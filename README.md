# Android-Malware-Detection
Android Malware Detection using Deep Learning
* Classification of android apps done based on pseudo-dynamic analysis of system API Call sequences.
* Developed a Deep Convolutional Neural network (CNN) and a Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM) model.
* Compared performance of these Deep Neural Network models with Naive Bayes Classifier.
